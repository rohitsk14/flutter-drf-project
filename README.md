## Structure
In a RESTful API, endpoints (URLs) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints should be logically organized around collections and elements, both of which are resources.
|Endpoint   |  HTTP Method |  CRUD Method | Result  |   
|---|---|---|---|
| ```viewset/details/```  |  GET | READ  | Get all namecards  |   
|  ```viewset/details/``` | POST  | CREATE  | Create a new namecard  |   
|  ```viewset/details/id``` |  GET | READ  | Get a specific namecard |
|  ```viewset/details/id``` |  PUT | UPDATE  | Update a specific namecard 
|  ```viewset/details/id``` |  Delete | DELETE  | Delete a specific namecard
